	<explanation>
		<text>You’ll see the first advance direction sign one mile from the exit. If you’re travelling at 60 mph in the right-hand lane you’ll only have about 50 seconds before you reach the countdown markers. There will be another sign at the half-mile point. Move in to the left-hand lane in good time. Don’t cut across traffic at the last moment and don’t risk missing your exit.</text>
