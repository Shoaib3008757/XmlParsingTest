	<explanation>
		<text>If you’re following another road user in fog stay well back. The driver in front won’t be able to see hazards until they’re close and might brake suddenly. Another reason why it is important to maintain a good separation distance in fog is that the road surface is likely to be wet and slippery.</text>
