	<explanation>
		<text>Coasting is when you allow the vehicle to freewheel in neutral or with the clutch pedal depressed. Speed will increase as you lose the benefits of engine braking and have less control. You shouldn’t coast, especially when approaching hazards such as junctions or bends and when travelling downhill.</text>
