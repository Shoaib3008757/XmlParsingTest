	<explanation>
		<text>Try to look ahead and read the road. Plan your approach to junctions and select the correct gear in good time. This will give you the control you need to deal with any hazards that occur. You’ll coast a little every time you change gear. This can’t be avoided, but it should be kept to a minimum.</text>
