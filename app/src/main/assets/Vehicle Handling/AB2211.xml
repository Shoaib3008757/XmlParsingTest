	<explanation>
		<text>The purpose of a box junction is to keep the junction clear by preventing vehicles from stopping in the path of crossing traffic. You must not enter a box junction unless your exit is clear. But, you may enter the box and wait if you want to turn right and are only prevented from doing so by oncoming traffic.</text>
