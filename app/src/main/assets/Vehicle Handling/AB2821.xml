	<explanation>
		<text>A ford is a crossing over a stream that’s shallow enough to go through. After you’ve gone through a ford or deep puddle the water will affect your brakes. To dry them out apply a light brake pressure while moving slowly. Don’t travel at normal speeds until you are sure your brakes are working properly again.</text>
