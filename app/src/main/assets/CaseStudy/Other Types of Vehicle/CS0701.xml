		<text>Itâ€™s dry but very windy. On the motorway, you see a car towing a large caravan in the middle lane. You then move onto a long open stretch of single carriageway, where you pass a motorcyclist. Later, you are travelling behind a long vehicle and want to overtake. Once in town, there are trams directed by traffic light signals and you have to drive across their tracks. Further on, a bus is signalling its intention to pull out from a bus stop.</text>
		<part>What is the national motorway speed limit for the vehicle and caravan?</part>
