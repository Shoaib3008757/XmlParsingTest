		<xref>DES s8, HC r186</xref>
		<text>Sam is driving in heavy traffic. It has rained, but now bright sun is causing glare on the wet road.  A car overtakes, then pulls back sharply into the traffic just in front of Sam.  Further on thereâ€™s a roundabout with two lanes on approach. Sam needs to take the first exit, turning left. A large vehicle in front signals left but straddles both lanes.  The traffic is still heavy, and there is a zebra crossing up ahead.  There are people waiting to cross.</text>
		<part>How should Sam be positioned on approach to the roundabout?</part>
