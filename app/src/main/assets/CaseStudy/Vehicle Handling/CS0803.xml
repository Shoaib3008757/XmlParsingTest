		<text>Alan is driving in very thick fog and the road surface is also rather damp.  Alan is using fog lights as well as headlights.  He leaves a larger gap than normal between himself and the vehicle in front.  Later, a gutter drain is being unblocked and the pumping vehicle is obstructing the road on
Alan’s side. Still further on, there are rumble devices on approach to a roundabout.
</text>
		<part>Why would Alan leave a larger gap between vehicles? </part>
