		<text>It’s early evening and street lamps are lit. Anita is driving home at 30 mph, although there are no speed limit signs. The road is a single carriageway and Anita is alone in her vehicle.  Sleet is falling steadily and it’s cold.  Ahead, a vehicle is spreading salt on the road.  In town there are high-occupancy vehicle lanes which Anita does not use. Her home is level with a zebra crossing but she parks beyond its markings further down the road.</text>
		<part>What would the normal centre white line marking be on this road?</part>
