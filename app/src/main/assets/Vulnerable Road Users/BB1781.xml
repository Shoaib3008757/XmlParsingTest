	<explanation>
		<text>Where there are yellow zigzag markings, you should not park, wait or stop, even to pick up or drop off children. A vehicle parked on the zigzag lines would obstruct children's view of the road and other drivers view of the pavement. Where there is an upright sign there is mandatory prohibition of stopping during the times shown.</text>
