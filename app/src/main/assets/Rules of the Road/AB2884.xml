	<explanation>
		<text>To go straight ahead at a roundabout you should normally approach in the left-hand lane. You will not normally need to signal, but look out for the road markings. At some roundabouts the left lane on approach is marked as ‘left turn only’, so make sure you use the correct lane to go ahead. Signal before you leave as other road users need to know your intentions.</text>
