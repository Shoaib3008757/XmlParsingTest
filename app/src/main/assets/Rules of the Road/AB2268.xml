	<explanation>
		<text>Red rear reflectors show up when headlights shine on them. These are useful when you are parked at night but will only reflect if you park in the same direction as the traffic flow. Normally you should park on the left, but if you’re in a one-way street you may also park on the right-hand side.</text>
