<explanation>
		<text>If the driver behind is following too closely, there’s a danger they’ll collide with the back of your car if you stop suddenly. You can reduce this risk by slowing down and increasing the safety margin in front of you. This reduces the chance that you’ll have to stop suddenly and allows you to spread your braking over a greater distance. This is an example of defensive driving.</text>
