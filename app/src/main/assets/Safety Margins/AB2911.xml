	<explanation>
		<text>On busy roads traffic may still travel at high speeds despite being close together. Don’t follow too closely to the vehicle in front. If a driver behind seems to be ‘pushing’ you, gradually increase your distance from the vehicle in front by slowing down gently. This will give you more space in front if you have to brake, and lessen the risk of a collision involving several vehicles.</text>
