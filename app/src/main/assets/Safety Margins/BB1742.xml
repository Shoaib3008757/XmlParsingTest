	<explanation>
		<text>Coasting, is the term used when the clutch is held down, or the gear lever is in neutral, and the vehicle is allowed to freewheel. This reduces the driver’s control of the vehicle. When you coast, the engine can’t drive the wheels to pull you through a corner. Coasting also removes the assistance of engine braking that helps to slow the car.</text>
