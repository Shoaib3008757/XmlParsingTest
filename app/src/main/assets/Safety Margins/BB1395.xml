	<explanation>
		<text>If you drive at speed in very wet conditions your steering may suddenly feel ‘light’. This means that the tyres have lifted off the surface of the road and are skating on the surface of the water. This is known as aquaplaning. Reduce speed by easing off the accelerator, but don’t brake until your steering returns to normal.</text>
