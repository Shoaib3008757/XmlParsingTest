		<text>Harsh use of the accelerator, brakes or steering is likely to lead to skidding, especially on slippery surfaces. Avoid steering and braking at the same time. In icy conditions it’s very important that you constantly assess what’s ahead, so that you can take appropriate action in plenty of time.</text>
