	<explanation>
		<text>Don’t venture out if your journey isn’t necessary. If you have to travel and someone is expecting you at the other end, let them know that you’ll be taking longer than usual for your journey. This will stop them worrying if you don’t turn up on time and will also take the pressure off you, so you don’t feel you have to rush.</text>
