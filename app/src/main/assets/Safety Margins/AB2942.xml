	<explanation>
		<text>When it’s foggy, use dipped headlights. This will help you see and be seen by other road users. If visibility is seriously reduced, consider using front and rear fog lights if you have them. Keep to a sensible speed and don’t follow the vehicle in front too closely. If the road is wet and slippery, you’ll need to allow twice the normal stopping distance.</text>
