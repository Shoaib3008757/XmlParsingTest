	<explanation>
		<text>Try to give way to buses if you can do so safely, especially when they signal to pull away from bus stops. Look out for people who’ve stepped off the bus or are running to catch it, and may try to cross the road without looking. Don’t try to accelerate past before it moves away or flash your lights as other road users may be misled by this signal.</text>
