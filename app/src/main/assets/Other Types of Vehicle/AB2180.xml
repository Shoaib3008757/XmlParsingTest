	<explanation>
		<text>When a long vehicle is going to turn right it may need to keep close to the left-hand kerb. This is to prevent the rear end of the trailer cutting the corner. You need to be aware of how long vehicles behave in such situations. Don’t overtake the lorry because it could turn as you’re alongside. Stay behind and wait for it to turn.</text>
