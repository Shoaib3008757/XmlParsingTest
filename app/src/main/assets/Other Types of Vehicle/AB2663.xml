	<explanation>
		<text>When turning into narrow roads articulated and long vehicles will need more room. Initially they will need to swing out in the opposite direction to which they intend to turn. They could mask another vehicle turning out of the same junction. DON’T be tempted to overtake them or pass on the inside.</text>
