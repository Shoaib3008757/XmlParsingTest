<explanation>
		<text>Before emerging right onto a dual carriageway make sure that the central reserve is deep enough to protect your vehicle. If it’s not, you should treat it as one road and check that it’s clear in both directions before pulling out. Neglecting to do this could place part or all of your vehicle in the path of approaching traffic and cause a collision.</text>
