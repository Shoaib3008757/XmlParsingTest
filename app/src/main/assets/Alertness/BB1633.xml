<explanation>
		<text>Windscreen pillars can completely block your view of pedestrians, motorcyclists and pedal cyclists. You should particularly watch out for these road users; don’t just rely on a quick glance. Where possible make eye contact with them so you can be sure they have seen you too.</text>
