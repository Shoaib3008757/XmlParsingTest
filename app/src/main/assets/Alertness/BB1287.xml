<explanation>
		<text>It’s easy to be distracted. Planning your journey before you set off is important. A few sensible precautions are to tune your radio to stations in your area of travel, take planned breaks, and plan your route. Except for emergencies, it’s illegal to use a hand-held mobile phone while driving. Even using a hands-free kit can severely distract your attention.</text>
