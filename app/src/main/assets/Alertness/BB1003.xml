<explanation>
		<text>You shouldn’t allow yourself to be distracted when driving. You need to concentrate fully in order to be safe on the road. Loud music could mask other sounds, such as the audible warning of an emergency vehicle. Any distraction that causes you to take your hands off the steering wheel or your eyes off the road could be dangerous.</text>
