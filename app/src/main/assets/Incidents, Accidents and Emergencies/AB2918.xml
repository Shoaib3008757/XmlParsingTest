	<explanation>
		<text>Remember DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airway, Breathing, Compressions). An unconscious casualty may have difficulty breathing. Check that their airway is clear by tilting the head back gently. Unblock the airway if necessary, then make sure the casualty is breathing. Compressions may need to be given to maintain circulation.</text>
