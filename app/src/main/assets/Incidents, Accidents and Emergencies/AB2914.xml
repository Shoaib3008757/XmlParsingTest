	<explanation>
		<text>If you’re the first to arrive at a crash scene the first concerns are the risk of further collision and fire. Ensuring that vehicle engines are switched off will reduce the risk of fire. Use hazard warning lights so that other traffic knows there’s a need for caution. Make sure the emergency services are contacted, don’t assume this has already been done.</text>
