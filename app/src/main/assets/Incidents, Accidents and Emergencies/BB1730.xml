	<explanation>
		<text>It’s usually better to drive a burning vehicle out of a tunnel. If you can’t do this, pull over and stop at an emergency point if possible. Switch off the engine, use hazard warning lights, and leave the vehicle immediately. Call for help from the nearest emergency point. If you have an extinguisher it may help to put out a small fire, but don’t try to tackle a large one.</text>
