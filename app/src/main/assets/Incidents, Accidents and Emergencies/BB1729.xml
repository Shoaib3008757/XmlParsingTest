	<explanation>
		<text>The main dangers in a tunnel fire are suffocation and smoke. If you can do so safely it’s better to drive a burning vehicle out of a tunnel. If you can’t do this, pull over, switch off the engine, use hazard warning lights and phone immediately for help. It may be possible to put out a small fire but if it seems large do NOT tackle it!</text>
