	<explanation>
		<text>This is the minimum distance to place the triangle from the obstruction. If there’s a bend or hump in the road place it so that approaching traffic has plenty of time to react to the warning and slow down. You may also need to use your hazard warning lights, especially in poor visibility or at night.</text>
