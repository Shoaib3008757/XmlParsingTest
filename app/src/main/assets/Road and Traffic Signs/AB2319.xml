	<explanation>
		<text>Priority signs are normally shown where the road is narrow and there isn’t enough room for two vehicles to pass. These can be at narrow bridges, road works and where there’s a width restriction. Make sure that you know who has priority, don’t force your way through. Show courtesy and consideration to other road users.</text>
