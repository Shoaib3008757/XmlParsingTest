	<explanation>
		<text>There might be an occasion where another driver uses an arm signal. This may be because the vehicle’s indicators are obscured by other traffic. In order for such signals to be effective all drivers should know the meaning of them. Be aware that the ‘left turn’ signal might look similar to the ‘slowing down’ signal.</text>
