	<explanation>
		<text>If you’re travelling on a dual carriageway that becomes a single carriageway road, reduce your speed gradually so that you aren’t exceeding the limit as you enter. There might not be a sign to remind you of the limit, so make sure you know what the speed limits are for different types of roads and vehicles.</text>
