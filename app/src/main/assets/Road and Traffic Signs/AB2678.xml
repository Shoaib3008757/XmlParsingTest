	<explanation>
		<text>Yellow ‘box junctions’ like this are often used where it’s busy. Their purpose is to keep the junction clear for crossing traffic. Don’t enter the painted area unless your exit is clear. The exception to this is when you are turning right and are only prevented from doing so by oncoming traffic or by other vehicles waiting to turn right.</text>
