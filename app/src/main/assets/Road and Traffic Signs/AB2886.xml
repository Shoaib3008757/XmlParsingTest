	<explanation>
		<text>Buses and cycles can travel in this lane. In this case they will flow in the same direction as other traffic. If it’s busy they may be passing you on the left, so watch out for them. Times on the sign will show its hours of operation. No times shown, or no sign at all, means it’s 24 hours. In some areas other vehicles, such as taxis and motorcycles, are allowed to use bus lanes. The sign will show these.</text>
