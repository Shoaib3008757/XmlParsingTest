	<explanation>
		<text>Some people might take longer to cross the road. They may be older or have a disability. Be patient and don’t hurry them by showing your impatience. They might have poor eyesight or not be able to hear traffic approaching. If pedestrians are standing at the side of the road, don’t signal or wave them to cross. Other road users may not have seen your signal and this could lead the pedestrians into a hazardous situation.</text>
