	<explanation>
		<text>Think about the effect your parking will have on other road users. Don’t forget that not all vehicles are the size of a car. Large vehicles will need more room to pass and might need more time too. Parking out of the view of traffic, such as before the brow of a hill, causes unnecessary risks. Think before you park.</text>
