	<explanation>
		<text>It can be frustrating and worrying to find your planned route is blocked by roadworks or diversions. If you have planned an alternative you will feel less stressed and more able to concentrate fully on your driving or riding. If your original route is mostly on motorways it’s a good idea to plan an alternative using non-motorway roads. Always carry a map with you just in case you need to refer to it.</text>
