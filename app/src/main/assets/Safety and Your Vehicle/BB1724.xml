	<explanation>
		<text>Missing out some gears helps to reduce the amount of time you are accelerating and this saves fuel. You don’t always need to change up or down through each gear. As you accelerate between each gear more fuel is injected into the engine than if you had maintained constant acceleration. Fewer gear changes means less fuel used.</text>
